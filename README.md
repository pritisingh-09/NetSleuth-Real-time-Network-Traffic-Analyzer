# 🕵️‍♀️ NetSleuth: Real-time Network Traffic Analyzer

**NetSleuth** is a Python-based real-time network traffic analyzer designed to inspect, capture, and visualize packet-level network data on local interfaces. Whether you're a student, cybersecurity enthusiast, or network administrator, this tool helps you monitor, debug, and understand traffic flow with ease.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 📡 Live packet sniffing from local network interfaces  
- 🔍 Real-time display of:
  - IP addresses
  - Protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  - Packet size
  - Port numbers
- 📊 Optional logging for later analysis
- 🐍 Python-powered, simple and fast

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/) – for packet sniffing  
- [socket](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) – for hostname/IP resolution  
- Terminal-based display (customizable)
